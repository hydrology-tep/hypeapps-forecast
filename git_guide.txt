Working with git in this project

=== The idea is that when you have a task to do you ===
1. Create a new git branch
2. Finish your task in your git branch
3. Combine (merge) your branch into the original (develop) branch

=== To do this ===
1. Clone down the project
for example:
# git clone git@github.com:hydrology-tep/hypeapps-forecast.git
# cd hypeapps-forecast
# git checkout develop

2. Ensure you have the latest code
# git pull

3. Create a new branch, note the -b
git checkout -b my-task

4. Do your work until its done
Coding...

4. Commit your work
git add ./path_to_my_changed_file ./path_to_my_changed_file2
git commit -m "Comment about your work"
git push

5. Go to the project webpage and create a merge request from your branch into the original branch
# example at https://github.com/hydrology-tep/hypeapps-forecast/commits/develop

6. You or someone else now accepts the merge request on the webpage

===== Tips ====
* Everyday before you start working run
git pull

* If you run into problems
  1. Copy the files you want to keep into a separate directory
  2. Delete the entire project folder
  3. Clone down the project again
  4. git checkout my_branch
